# Note
Components in the `ui/` folder should be generic and reusable.

# UI testing
Unit testing for UI components is generally considered not useful. For UI testing this project has been set-up with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) and [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/). The latter is especially useful so we can accept/reject specific UI changes and catch breaking changes.
